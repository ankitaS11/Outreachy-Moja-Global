conda create --name outreachy python=3.8
```

Install requirements:

```

## Automation

1. Just run the `script.py` file.
2. A `result.json` will be generated if everything works well. The plots will be saved to your folder as well! :)

## Objective

The objectives of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset of India are:

1. Narrow down the exploration to 2 states: Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh (both are adjacent to each other).
2. Why Chhattisgarh has more amount of forests and plantation of rich serials as compared to Madhya Pradesh?
3. Observe any climate, ecological, soil type differences between the two states.

## Some Statistics

Some statistics before we start:

(2014-2015)

* **Forests in Chhattisgarh State**: 45.80% of the available land. [Source](https://fsi.nic.in/isfr19/vol2/isfr-2019-vol-ii-chhattisgarh.pdf)
* **Forests in Madhya Pradesh State**: 28.27% of the available land. [Source](https://fsi.nic.in/isfr19/vol2/isfr-2019-vol-ii-madhya-pradesh.pdf)

## Hypothesis

Before starting the EDA, I would like to make a hypothesis and assert if we were right or not:

_Note: I have lived in Chhattisgarh for more than 18 years, so have some background knowledge about it_

1. Chhattisgarh grows huge amount of rice because of the ample amount of rainfall it receives.
2. The community of Chhattisgarh has protected it's forest land, and hence the development hasn't been that active, as compared to Madhya Pradesh.
3. Chhattisgarh has one of the biggest waterfalls of India, which also contributes to it's tourism. Hence, forests have been protected more than ever.
